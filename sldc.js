// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

// 1. Planning: "plan what you're going to build and what you're going to use to build"
// 2. Analysis of Requirenments: "what you actually need to build and what tools you need"
// 3. Design: "what it looks like, how the different peices will fit together"
// 4. Implementation: "write the code according to design"
// 5. Testing and Integration: "test it to see if it works, deploy it to make it accessible for others to use"
// 6. Maintain: "make sure its working properly and maintained regulary"

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
